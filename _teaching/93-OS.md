I have been a teaching assistant for the Operating Systems course during the Summer semester.

In this course, fundamental topics in operating systems were covered. I labs based on the taught materials and was responsible for grading programming assignments and project submissions.  
The key topics included:
- Process Management and Scheduling  
- Memory Management  
- Virtual Memory  
- File Systems  
- Concurrency and Synchronization  
- Deadlocks  
- Input/Output Systems  
- Operating System Security  

I served as the teaching assistant for [Dr. Kenneth B. Kent](https://www.cs.unb.ca/~ken/) in 2025.
