I have been a teacher assistant of advanced computer programming in four semesters. In this course, students learn Object-Oriented Programming with Java programming language. As a teacher assistant, I designed two projects for midterm and final also wrote about four series of homework for students.

Usually, the final project contained GUI part with JavaFX or Swing, which I have taught JavaFX during the term in one or two sessions.

I have been the teaching assistant of [Dr. Samad Paydar](http://www.um.ac.ir/~s-paydar) and [Dr. Mostafa Nouri Baigy](http://nouribaygi.profcms.um.ac.ir/) in 2018 and 2019.
