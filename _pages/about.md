AI Researcher | M.Sc. Computer Science at UNB

I’m an AI Researcher and M.Sc. Computer Science student at the University of New Brunswick, focusing on machine learning, IoT, and robotics. At UNB’s AELab, I design and optimize intelligent systems, combining AI with real-world data to solve complex problems. My experience includes developing ML microservices, predictive models, and anomaly detection systems using Python, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. I’ve contributed to publications on fall detection, explainable health diagnostics, and federated learning. With a strong foundation in data preprocessing, model deployment, and interdisciplinary collaboration, I aim to apply AI in meaningful, scalable ways.
